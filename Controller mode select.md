Game mode selection

Unlike other similar firmwares, HayBox by default allows you to switch modes on the fly without unplugging your controller. This is mainly useful on PC, as opposed to console where you usually have to restart the console to switch game anyway. It also serves the purpose of reducing the number of buttons you have to hold with one hand while plugging in.

The default controller mode button combinations are:

    Mod X + Start + L - Melee mode (default)
    Mod X + Start + Left - Project M/Project+ mode
    Mod X + Start + Down - Ultimate mode
    Mod X + Start + Right - FGC mode (Hitbox style fighting game layout)
    Mod X + Start + B - Rivals of Aether mode

Default keyboard mode button combinations (only available when using DInput backend, not with XInput):

    Mod Y + Start + L - Default keyboard mode
